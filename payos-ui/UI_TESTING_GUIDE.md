## New Flows: Organization & Auth (Phase 1.5)

These flows are primarily API-level for now (the UI does not yet expose full org/team management), but Gemini should still verify them via HTTP calls.

### Flow 20: Self-Service Signup (API)

- **Goal**: Verify that a new organization and owner user can be created via API and that API keys and session tokens are returned.
- **Preconditions**:
  - API server running at `http://localhost:4000`
  - No existing user with the target email
- **Steps**:
  1. Call `POST /v1/auth/signup` with a fresh email:
     ```bash
     curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/auth/signup \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "email": "gemini-signup-<timestamp>@example.com",
         "password": "SecureP@ss123456",
         "organizationName": "Gemini Test Org <timestamp>",
         "userName": "Gemini Owner"
       }'
     ```
  2. Verify the response structure:
     - `user.id`, `user.email`, `user.name` present.
     - `tenant`/`organization` object with `id`, `name`, `status`.
     - `apiKeys.test.key` and `apiKeys.live.key` present.
     - `session.accessToken` and `session.refreshToken` present (may be `null` if token creation fails; treat as non-blocking).
  3. Confirm that keys look like:
     - `pk_test_...`
     - `pk_live_...`
  4. Confirm that keys are only shown in this response (they will not be retrievable later).

- **Expected Result**:
  - HTTP `201`.
  - Organization is created and visible in subsequent calls (see next flow).

### Flow 21: Login & Me (API)

- **Goal**: Verify login, lockout protection, and `/v1/auth/me`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use the email/password from Flow 20.
  2. Call `POST /v1/auth/login`:
     ```bash
     curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/auth/login \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "email": "<signup-email>",
         "password": "SecureP@ss123456"
       }'
     ```
  3. Verify:
     - `user.id`, `user.email`, `user.role` (`owner`), `user.name` are present.
     - `tenant` object has `id`, `name`, `status: "active"`.
     - `session.accessToken` and `session.refreshToken` are non-empty strings.
  4. Call `GET /v1/auth/me` with the `accessToken`:
     ```bash
     TOKEN="<access-token-from-login>"
     curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:4000/v1/auth/me
     ```
  5. Verify:
     - The same user and tenant information as login.

- **Negative Case**:
  - Call `POST /v1/auth/login` with the correct email and wrong password at least once.
  - Expected: HTTP `400` with `{ "error": "Invalid credentials" }`.

- **Expected Result**:
  - Login works with valid creds, fails correctly with invalid ones.
  - `/v1/auth/me` returns current user and organization.

### Flow 22: Organization Profile (API)

- **Goal**: Verify `GET /v1/organization` and `PATCH /v1/organization` for the current user’s organization.
- **Steps**:
  1. Obtain an `accessToken` via Flow 21.
  2. Call `GET /v1/organization`:
     ```bash
     TOKEN="<access-token-from-login>"
     curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:4000/v1/organization
     ```
  3. Verify:
     - Response has an `organization` object.
     - Fields: `id`, `name`, `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
  4. Call `PATCH /v1/organization` to change the name:
     ```bash
     curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/v1/organization \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "name": "Updated Org Name (Gemini)"
       }'
     ```
  5. Verify:
     - Response `organization.name` matches the new name.
     - `updatedAt` is later than the previous value.
  6. Call `GET /v1/organization` again and confirm the updated name persists.

- **Negative Cases**:
  - Call `GET /v1/organization` without `Authorization` → expect `401`.
  - Call `PATCH /v1/organization` with no body `{}` → expect `400` with `error: "No changes provided"`.

- **Expected Result**:
  - Authenticated users see their organization.
  - Owners/admins can rename the organization.

### Flow 23: Organization Team (API)

- **Goal**: Verify `GET /v1/organization/team` returns the list of team members for the current organization.
- **Steps**:
  1. Obtain an `accessToken` via Flow 21 (login as the owner user).
  2. Call `GET /v1/organization/team`:
     ```bash
     TOKEN="<access-token-from-login>"
     curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:4000/v1/organization/team
     ```
  3. Verify:
     - Response has a `members` array.
     - For the initial owner-only setup:
       - `members.length` is at least 1.
       - The first member has:
         - `role: "owner"`
         - `name` matching the signup or login user (e.g., `"Test User"` / `"Gemini Owner"`).
         - `invited: false`
         - `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps.
  4. (Later, when invites are implemented) verify that invited-but-not-accepted users show:
     - `invited: true`
     - `inviteExpiresAt` is in the future.
     - `inviteAcceptedAt` is `null`.

- **Negative Cases**:
  - Call `GET /v1/organization/team` without `Authorization` → expect `401`.

- **Expected Result**:
  - Authenticated users can list all team members for their organization.
  - Owners/admins can see who is active vs invited (once invites are wired).

> Note: For now, the dashboard UI does not yet expose a full organization settings page. These flows are **API-only** and are meant to ensure backend correctness before the UI is wired up.

### Flow 24: Organization Team Role & Removal Safety (API)

- **Goal**: Verify that role changes and removals are protected (cannot remove last owner, cannot leave via team API).
- **Preconditions**:
  - Only one member exists (the owner created in Flow 20).
- **Steps**:
  1. Obtain an `accessToken` via Flow 21.
  2. Try to change the owner’s role:
     ```bash
     TOKEN="<access-token-from-login>"
     OWNER_ID="<user-id-from-Flows-20-21>"
     curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/v1/organization/team/$OWNER_ID \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
