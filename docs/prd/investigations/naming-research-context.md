**Current best candidates:** Liso, Bailey, Leila, Pera  
**Status:** Continue validation on top candidates, generate fresh directions

---

## ✅ PROMISING CANDIDATES

### Top Tier (Verified Clear or Minimal Conflict)

| Name | Status | Meaning/Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Liso** | ✅ Clear | "Smooth" in Spanish. Only defunct Salesforce partner found (not fintech). Perfect brand fit for frictionless settlement. |
| **Bailey** | ✅ Possible | Person name meaning "steward." Bailey & Company is healthcare investment banking (not consumer fintech). Needs domain check. |
| **Leila** | ⚠️ Risky | Arabic origin, beautiful sound. Close to Layla (money transfer app) and Lili (business banking fintech). Could work with differentiation. |
| **Pera** | ⚠️ Risky | Spanish for "pear" AND means "money" in Tagalog. Pera Labs (Turkey fintech), Pera Finance (DeFi) exist. Sounds like Perpay. Worth exploring. |

## 🎯 NAMING CRITERIA

### Must-Haves

- No direct fintech/payments conflicts
- Works in English and Spanish markets
- Easy to pronounce and spell
- Trademark-able

### Nice-to-Haves

- Memorable
- Works as a verb ("Just [name] it")

### Brand Values to Evoke
- Removing complexity
- Smooth/frictionless settlement  
- Trust/governance for enterprise
- Crossing boundaries (protocols ↔ local rails)
- Infrastructure that "just works"
- The "ground station" connecting stablecoins to local money

---

## 📊 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Naming is So Hard in Fintech
- Every simple English word is taken by a funded startup
- The "simple word + payments vertical" formula is exhausted
- Even invented names often have conflicts
- LATAM-specific terms sometimes have existing players
- Fruit names are surprisingly crowded (Mango, Guava, Kiwi all blocked)
- Person names that suggest finance roles also crowded
- "Union" synonyms (Alliance, Accord, Bond, Guild) all have major conflicts
- Portuguese/Italian words have hidden landmines (Elo = Brazil's national card network!)
- "Zen" prefix is extremely crowded in fintech
- Astronomy names (Pollux) may have LATAM conflicts

### What's Working
- Spanish words less saturated than English
- Invented combinations with Spanish roots
- Names that don't obviously scream "payments" may be clearer

### Categories Exhausted (High Conflict Rate)
- Simple English payment words
- Fruit names
- Agent/role names (Herald, Envoy, etc.)
- "Flow/smooth/clear" metaphors
- Union synonyms (Alliance, Accord, Bond, Guild)
- Textile weaving names (Twill)
- Swahili words (Rahisi)

### Categories Worth Exploring
- Obscure Spanish words
- Completely invented 2-syllable names
- Non-obvious metaphors (astronomy, geology, architecture)
- Portuguese/Italian words
- Weather/wind names
- Tool/instrument names
