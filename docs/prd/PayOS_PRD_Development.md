## Why the Restructure?

The original monolithic PRD (v1.15) had grown to 14,000+ lines across 35 epics, making it:
- ❌ Difficult to navigate for focused work
- ❌ Inefficient for LLM context windows
- ❌ Hard to maintain epic-specific documentation

The new modular structure provides:
- ✅ **Master PRD**: Executive summary + Epic Dashboard (~1,900 lines)
- ✅ **Individual Epic Files**: Focused documents for active/future epics
- ✅ **Archive Directory**: Completed foundation epics (1-16)
- ✅ **Better Context Efficiency**: Load only what you need
- ✅ **Easier Collaboration**: Clear separation of concerns

**Always refer to the Master PRD for accurate project status and epic tracking.**
