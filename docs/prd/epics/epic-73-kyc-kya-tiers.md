# Epic 73: KYC/KYA Tier Implementation

**Status:** Complete
**Phase:** 4.3 (Compliance & Governance)
**Priority:** P0
**Total Points:** 116
**Stories:** 19
**Dependencies:** Epic 3 (Agent System & KYA), Epic 72 (Agent Key-Pair Auth)
**Created:** March 31, 2026
**Companion Docs:** CAI Framework (Working Paper III), PRD Master v1.26
**Spec:** Sly_KYC_KYA_Tier_Specification v1.0
**Implementation Notes:** [Per-Tenant Tier Limits with Platform Ceiling](../../completed/epics/EPIC_73_TIER_LIMITS_MULTITENANT.md) — follow-up that replaced the global `tier_limits` design from Story 73.1 with a tenant-scoped + ceiling-enforced model.

---

## Overview

Implement unified KYC/KYB account tiers (T0-T3) and KYA agent tiers (T0-T3) with progressive verification, spending limits, and CAI framework integration. This epic replaces the placeholder KYC/KYA verification in Epic 3 with a production-ready tiered system.

## Design Principles

1. **Compliance should feel like a feature, not a gate.** Users should think "this platform takes security seriously" not "this platform won't let me in."
2. **Unified ladder, diverging verification.** One tier structure for persons and businesses. Different documents required, different caps at upper tiers.
3. **Progressive disclosure.** Friction appears only when use case demands higher limits. Upgrade is triggered by actual usage, not arbitrary gates.
4. **Declare at entry, validate through behavior.** Agents self-declare capabilities at registration. Platform validates declarations through observed transaction patterns.
5. **Agent limits bounded by parent.** effective_limit = MIN(KYA tier limit, parent account tier limit). Always.
6. **Unlimited agents, limited spending.** Agent count is not capped at any tier. Spending limits are the risk control. Agent count belongs in commercial pricing, not compliance.

## Account Tiers (KYC/KYB)

| Tier | Name | Verification | Per Tx | Daily | Monthly |
|------|------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| T0 | Explore | Email only + IP geolocation + disposable domain check | $100 | $500 | $2,000 |
| T1 | Starter | + legal name, DOB, country, sanctions/PEP screening | $500 | $2,000 | $10,000 |
| T2 Person | Verified | + government ID, liveness, proof of address (Persona) | $5,000 | $20,000 | $100,000 |
| T2 Business | Verified | + registration docs, UBO, business address, signatory ID | $50,000 | $200,000 | $500,000 |
| T3 | Enterprise | + audited financials, source of funds, enhanced UBO, ongoing monitoring | Custom | Custom | Custom |

**No max agents at any tier.** Unlimited agent registration.

## Agent Tiers (KYA)

| Tier | Name | Requirements | Per Tx | Daily | Monthly | CAI Layers |
|------|------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|------------|
| T0 | Registered | Agent name, description, API key | $10 | $50 | $200 | 1 (partial), 4 (minimal) |
| T1 | Declared | + skill manifest, spending policy, escalation policy, use case | $100 | $500 | $2,000 | 1 (DSD), 3 (APT), 4 |
| T2 | Verified | + 30-day history OR enterprise override, zero violations, behavioral consistency | $1,000 | $5,000 | $20,000 | All 5 |
| T3 | Trusted | + security review, KYA-4 attestation, kill-switch operator, BRQ active | Custom | Custom | Custom | All 5 (fully verified) |

**Enterprise override:** T3 parent accounts can request expedited KYA-3 behavioral probes within 24-48 hours, bypassing the 30-day observation period.

## Inheritance Matrix

```
effective_limit = MIN(kya_tier.limit, parent_account_tier.limit)
```

| Parent Account Tier | KYA T0 | KYA T1 | KYA T2 | KYA T3 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| T0 ($100/tx) | $10/tx | $100/tx | $100/tx | $100/tx |
| T1 Person ($500/tx) | $10/tx | $100/tx | $500/tx | $500/tx |
| T2 Person ($5K/tx) | $10/tx | $100/tx | $1K/tx | Custom |
| T2 Business ($50K/tx) | $10/tx | $100/tx | $1K/tx | Custom |
| T3 Enterprise | $10/tx | $100/tx | $1K/tx | Custom |

## Verification Providers

| Phase | Provider | Function | Cost |
|-------|----------|----------|------|
| Pilot | Persona Starter | Sanctions/PEP screening, ID verification | Free (500/month) |
| Scale | Sumsub | KYC, KYB, AML screening | $1.35-1.85/check |
| All | Circle Compliance Engine | Transaction/address screening | Per API call (TBD) |
| Pilots | Partner Reliance (Zindigi, ACBA) | Inherited KYC | $0 |

## Pilot Mapping

| Pilot | Account Tier | KYA Tier | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Invu POS (production) | T3 Enterprise | KYA T2+ | POS settlement, many small tx |
| Zindigi (corporate) | T3 Enterprise | N/A | Regulated institution, partner reliance |
| Zindigi (end users) | T2 via reliance | KYA T1 | Consumer remittances |
| DN Invest | T3 Enterprise | KYA T2 (override) | Enterprise override for expedited KYA |
| ACBA Bank | T3 Enterprise | N/A | Mastercard issuer, partner reliance |
| Project Looking Glass | T2+ (Sly as parent) | KYA T0 | $0.10 payouts, CAI bootstrap event |

## Stories

### Phase 1: Database & Schema Foundation — 22 points

#### Story 73.1: Tier Limits Lookup Table (3 pts, P0)
**Linear:** SLY-508
**Status:** ✅ Complete — superseded by per-tenant refactor (April 19, 2026). See [`EPIC_73_TIER_LIMITS_MULTITENANT.md`](../../completed/epics/EPIC_73_TIER_LIMITS_MULTITENANT.md) for the final shape. The table originally shipped as global (one row per tier shared across all tenants) but was refactored to carry a `tenant_id` column: `NULL` rows are the platform ceiling, non-NULL rows are per-tenant overrides capped at the ceiling.

Create `tier_limits` table storing spending limits for all account and KYA tiers.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tier_limits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tier_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (tier_type IN ('account', 'kya')),
  tier_level INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (tier_level BETWEEN 0 AND 3),
  entity_type TEXT CHECK (entity_type IN ('person', 'business', NULL)),
  limit_per_tx NUMERIC(20,8),
  limit_daily NUMERIC(20,8),
  limit_monthly NUMERIC(20,8),
  max_active_streams INTEGER,
  max_flow_rate_per_stream NUMERIC(20,8),
  max_total_outflow NUMERIC(20,8),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## SDK Impact Assessment

| SDK Package | Impact | Changes |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| @payos/sdk | High | New tier status, upgrade, and trust-profile methods |
| MCP Server | Medium | Expose tier status and trust-profile as MCP tools |
| LangChain Tools | Medium | Trust-profile query as LangChain tool for agent-to-agent trust checks |

## Implementation Schedule

| Phase | Stories | Points | Dependencies |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1: Schema | 73.1-73.5 | 22 | None |
| Phase 2: T0-T1 | 73.6-73.9 | 18 | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3: T2-T3 | 73.10-73.14 | 34 | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4: KYA/CAI | 73.15-73.20 | 42 | Phase 1 (can parallel Phase 2-3) |

**Critical path for pilots:** Phase 1 + Phase 2 = 40 points. Enables email-only onboarding + T1 lightweight KYC.

**Phase 4 can start in parallel** with Phases 2-3 since KYA tiers only need the schema foundation (Phase 1).

## Completion Notes

- **Date completed:** April 14, 2026
- **Commit:** `7229b6b feat(epic-73): KYC/KYA tier implementation — unified verification ladder`
- **Scope:** All 19 stories implemented across 4 phases (116 points)
- **Migrations:** 5 applied to Supabase (tier limits, account fields, CAI fields, effective limit triggers, behavioral observations)
- **Stubs awaiting production credentials:** Persona SDK (`services/kyc/persona.ts`), Circle Compliance Engine (`services/compliance/circle-compliance.ts`), IP geolocation (`getCountryFromIP()` returns null)
- **Kill switch auth:** Works via API key when no operator designated; once operator is designated, only that operator or owner/admin can activate
- **T0 KYA limits:** $20/$100/$500 (marketplace-validated, diverges from spec's $10/$50/$200)
- **Completion doc:** [`docs/completed/EPIC_73_COMPLETE.md`](../../completed/EPIC_73_COMPLETE.md)
