# Sly — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.26
**Date:** March 18, 2026
**Status:** MPP Integration + Production Environment Mode (Revised) + Agent Contracting Governance + Platform Architecture & Card Networks

---

## Executive Summary

Sly is a **multi-protocol settlement infrastructure** for LATAM, enabling fintechs and AI agents to move money across borders using stablecoins with native local rail integration (Pix, SPEI). This PRD covers the PoC implementation that demonstrates:

1. **Core settlement infrastructure** — Quotes, transfers, multi-currency payouts
2. **Agent system** — AI agents as first-class actors with KYA verification
3. **Multi-protocol support** — x402 (Coinbase), AP2 (Google), ACP (Stripe/OpenAI), UCP (Google+Shopify), MPP (Stripe+Tempo)
4. **Money streaming** — Continuous per-second payments
5. **Partner dashboard** — Full UI for managing accounts, agents, and payments

### Strategic Positioning

> **"We don't care which protocol wins. Sly makes them all work."**

Five agentic payment protocols are now active (x402, AP2, ACP, UCP, MPP). Sly is the **only settlement layer** that:
- Supports all five protocols
- Has native LATAM rails (Pix/SPEI via Circle)
- Enables partners rather than competing with them

### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Focus | External Services | Timeline |
|-------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Full PoC with mocked externals | Supabase only | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 1.5** | AI visibility & demo polish | Supabase only | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | PSP table stakes (refunds, disputes, exports) | Supabase only | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 3** | Multi-protocol infrastructure (x402, AP2, ACP) | Supabase + Protocol APIs | ✅ Complete (Dec 28) |
| **Phase 3.5** | External sandbox integrations | + Circle, Coinbase, Google, Stripe | Current |
| **Phase 4** | Customer validation (parallel tracks) | + First customers | Next |
| **Phase 5** | Production hardening & scale | Settlement infrastructure | Concurrent |
| **Phase 6** | AI-Native infrastructure | Simulation, Workflows, Context API | Future |

**Phases 1-2 complete.** Phase 3 integrates real sandbox APIs. Phase 4-5 run in parallel: B2B customer acquisition + agentic protocol demos for YC/accelerator positioning.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), Hono, Vercel, Railway

## Version History

### Version 1.26 (March 18, 2026)
**Epic 71: Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) Integration — NEW**

MPP launched March 18, 2026. Co-authored by Stripe and Tempo Labs. IETF submission. Open protocol standardizing HTTP 402 for machine-to-machine payments. Supports multiple payment methods (Tempo stablecoins, Stripe cards, Lightning BTC) and intents (charge, session). 100+ services in directory at launch including OpenAI, Anthropic, Shopify. Tempo mainnet went live simultaneously.

**New Epic:**
- **Epic 71: MPP Integration** (73 pts, 16 stories, P0) — Four phases:
  - Phase 1: Client Foundation (30 pts) — mppx SDK, governance middleware, data model, audit trail, wallet provisioning
  - Phase 2: Sessions/Streaming (18 pts) — governed pay-as-you-go sessions, SSE streaming
  - Phase 3: Server Integration (13 pts) — accept MPP payments on Sly APIs, payer KYA verification
  - Phase 4: Dashboard/Discovery (12 pts) — monitoring, service directory, cross-protocol analytics

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Use official `mppx` SDK (TypeScript, Hono-native) — no custom provider needed
- Sly wraps `mppx` with governance middleware: policy check before every credential signing
- Tempo method is primary (permissionless). Stripe method conditional on access approval.
- Added `settlement_network` column to transfers for chain discrimination
- MPP is additive to existing protocol support (x402, AP2, ACP, UCP all unchanged)

**Strategic impact:**
- Sly agents gain access to 100+ paid services without per-service onboarding
- MPP sessions enable governed streaming payments natively (OAuth for money)
- Sly fills the governance gap in MPP (no KYA, no spending policies, no kill switch in the spec)
- Both Tempo hackathon sponsors (Tempo + Stripe) co-authored MPP

- Epic doc: `docs/prd/epics/epic-71-mpp-integration.md`
- Linear: SLY-477 through SLY-492 (16 stories)

### Version 1.25 (March 16, 2026)
**Epic 67: Production Environment Mode — REVISED to Separate Deployments**

Architecture review of v1.24's column+RLS approach revealed it is unsafe for real money:
1. Service role key bypasses ALL RLS (primary isolation mechanism was ineffective)
2. Single EVM private key per server (sandbox and production would share a hot wallet)
3. Global blockchain routing via env var (not per-request)
4. Single Circle API key per instance (can't serve sandbox and live from one process)
5. Rate limiting force-disabled (`true ||` at rate-limit.ts:42)

**Decision:** Separate deployments — two Railway services, same codebase, different env vars. Same Supabase project with environment column for defense-in-depth tagging only.

**Revised from 100 pts / 20 stories → 88 pts / 22 stories:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (24 pts) — schema migration, server validation middleware, RequestContext, health checks, route stamping, workers
- Phase 2: Production Guardrails (16 pts) — sandbox-only feature blocks, fix rate limiting, activation gate
- Phase 3: Infrastructure/DevOps (16 pts) — Railway dual deployment, Vercel config, CORS, secrets docs, CI/CD
- Phase 4: UI Integration (18 pts) — environment provider + URL switching, header toggle, badges, API keys page
- Phase 5: Migration & Rollout (14 pts) — verification script, seed updates, defense-in-depth RLS, launch runbook

**Linear changes:** 8 issues canceled/archived, 12 updated, 10 new created (SLY-433 through SLY-442)

---

### Version 1.24 (March 15, 2026)
**Epic 67: Production Environment Mode — Real Sandbox/Production Isolation (SUPERSEDED by v1.25)**

Original column+RLS approach. See v1.25 for the revised separate-deployments architecture.

**Documentation:**
- Epic doc: `docs/prd/epics/epic-67-production-environment-mode.md`
- Linear: SLY-413 through SLY-442

### Version 1.23 (March 1, 2026)
**Agent Contracting Governance — 5 Epics for Moltbook/OpenClaw Integration**

Gap analysis of the OpenClaw/Moltbook agent-to-agent contracting ecosystem identified 5 capabilities needed to position Sly as the governed settlement layer for autonomous agent contracts. Three are new epics; two are expansions of existing epics.

**New Epics:**
- **Epic 62: Escrow Orchestration** (38 pts, P0) — Wrap AgentEscrowProtocol on Base with enterprise governance: pre-escrow authorization, lifecycle monitoring, release governance, kill switch, and settlement to local rails (Pix/SPEI)
- **Epic 63: External Reputation Bridge** (25 pts, P0) — Read-only aggregation of ERC-8004, Mnemom, Vouched/MCP-I, and on-chain escrow history into unified 0–1000 trust score. Policy engine references tiers for counterparty gating
- **Epic 64: OpenClaw Governance Skill** (10 pts, P1) — Python skill package published to ClawHub that routes Moltbook agent contracting actions through Sly governance APIs

**Expanded Epics:**
- **Epic 18: Agent Wallets & Contract Policies** (23 → 35 pts) — Added 3 stories: Contract Policy Engine (18.7), Per-Counterparty Exposure Tracking (18.8), Negotiation Guardrails API (18.9)
- **Epic 29: Workflow Engine** (42 → 52 pts) — Expanded Stories 29.4 and 29.5 with contract governance expressions and escrow/reputation action types

**Strategic Impact:**
- Positions Sly as governance infrastructure for 1.5M+ Moltbook agents
- Escrow-to-local-rail settlement is unique differentiator (USDC → BRL via Pix after escrow release)
- 148 total new/revised points across 6-week implementation plan
- Dependency chain: Epic 18 + 29 (parallel) → Epic 62 + 63 (parallel) → Epic 64

**Documentation:**
- Epic docs: `docs/prd/epics/epic-62-escrow-orchestration.md`, `epic-63-external-reputation-bridge.md`, `epic-64-openclaw-governance-skill.md`

## Strategic Context

### The Agentic Payments Landscape (March 2026)

Five major protocols have emerged for AI agent payments:

| Protocol | Owner | Focus | Settlement Method | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **x402** | Coinbase/Cloudflare | Micropayments, API monetization | Stablecoin (USDC on Base) | Production |
| **AP2** | Google (60+ partners) | Agent authorization, mandates | Multi-rail (cards, banks, x402) | Production |
| **ACP** | Stripe/OpenAI | Consumer checkout, e-commerce | SharedPaymentToken | Production |
| **UCP** | Google+Shopify (20+ partners) | Full commerce lifecycle | Multi-handler (AP2, cards, wallets) | Production (Jan 11, 2026) |
| **MPP** | Stripe+Tempo (IETF submission) | Machine-to-machine payments | Multi-method (Tempo, Stripe, Card, Lightning) | **NEW** (Mar 18, 2026) |

**Key Insight:** UCP is a **superset** protocol that orchestrates x402/AP2/ACP rather than replacing them. MPP is the newest entrant, co-authored by Stripe and Tempo, standardizing HTTP 402 for programmatic payments with 100+ services at launch. Sly's multi-protocol strategy is validated — we're the governance layer, not picking winners.

**MPP Ecosystem Impact:**
- 100+ services in directory at launch (OpenAI, Anthropic, Shopify, Dune, Alchemy, fal.ai)
- Tempo mainnet launched simultaneously (sub-second finality, stablecoin-native fees)
- Stripe, Visa, and Lightspark extended MPP to cards, wallets, and Lightning
- Sessions primitive enables streaming/pay-as-you-go (OAuth for money)
- MCP transport binding means LLM-native payments
- MPP has NO governance layer — Sly fills the gap (Epic 71)

**UCP Ecosystem Impact:**
- Google AI Mode and Gemini will use UCP for shopping agents
- Shopify's 1M+ merchants will support UCP natively
- Sly can become a **UCP Payment Handler** for LATAM settlement
- AP2 mandates work inside UCP via the `dev.ucp.shopping.ap2_mandate` extension

## Revenue Model

### Transaction Revenue

| Stream | Mechanism | Take Rate | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Fiat Offramp** (35% of volume) | Settlement fee + FX spread | 0.65% + 0.35% | Only ~35% of B2B stablecoin payments convert to fiat |
| **Stablecoin Protocol Fees** | Gateway + routing | 0.15% + 0.10% | x402/AP2/ACP/UCP protocol handling |
| **Internal Transfers** | Ledger movements | 0.05% | Between accounts on platform |

### Platform Revenue

| Stream | Pricing | Target Customers |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Yield on Float** | 6% APY on 5-day average | All partners |
| **Compliance API** | $0.02/check | High-volume partners |
| **FX Intelligence** | $500/partner/month | Treasury-focused |
| **Treasury Dashboard** | $449/partner/month | Enterprise |
| **Escrow Services** | 0.5% on escrowed volume | B2B procurement |

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Company | Funding | Focus | Revenue Model | What They Don't Do |
|---------|---------|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Crossmint** | $23.6M | Multi-protocol wallets | Subscription + per-tx | No LATAM rails, competes with partners |
| **Skyfire** | $9.5M | Agent identity (KYA) | 2-3% per transaction | No settlement, no white-label |
| **Gr4vy** | ~$30M | Payment orchestration | SaaS + revenue share | Not stablecoin-native, no LATAM |
| **Kite** | $33M | L1 for agent payments | Chain fees | No local rails integration |
| **Natural** | $9.8M | B2B agentic workflows | Enterprise SaaS | No LATAM focus |

### Sly Differentiation

1. **Multi-protocol** — Not betting on one winner (x402 vs AP2 vs ACP)
2. **Native LATAM settlement** — Circle's Pix/SPEI = 12-month head start
3. **Partner-enabling** — White-label infrastructure, don't compete
4. **Both B2B and agentic** — Revenue today, positioned for tomorrow

- Manual approval + Circle API execution
- Prove the flow works end-to-end
- Document pain points and friction

### Phase 2: First Paying Customer (Weeks 7-10)

- 90-day pilot at 1.5% (vs their current 4-5%)
- Build case study with real metrics
- Target: >99% payout success rate

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 4-12)

- Customers 2-5 via referral/network
- Systematize onboarding
- Build self-serve dashboard

### Customer Validation Questions

## AI-Native Infrastructure

> **Design Philosophy:** Build horizontal primitives that compose into solutions, not vertical features for specific industries.

### Why AI-Native Matters

Sly's Identity 3 positioning as "AI-Native Settlement OS" requires infrastructure that AI agents can actually use. This means:

1. **Machine-parseable responses** — Agents can't interpret "Something went wrong"
2. **Simulation before execution** — Agents must reason about outcomes
3. **Composable workflows** — Same primitives serve procurement, batch payments, compliance
4. **Capability discovery** — Agent platforms need to understand what Sly can do

### How Primitives Compose

| Scenario | Primitives Used | Flow |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Procurement approval** | Simulation → Workflow → Metadata | Simulate payment → Approval chain → Execute with PO# |
| **Batch payroll** | Simulation → Workflow → Decomposition | Simulate batch → HR + Finance approval → Track per-employee |
| **CS partial refund** | Context → Decomposition → Simulation | Get account context → Select line items → Preview refund |
| **Agent integration** | Discovery → Simulation → Structured | Discover capabilities → Dry-run action → Parse response |

### AI-Native Epics Summary

| Epic | Name | Points | Priority | Status |
|------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 28 | Simulation Engine 🔮 | 24 | P0 | ✅ Complete |
| 29 | Workflow Engine ⚙️ | 52 | P0/P1 | Pending |

| 34 | Transaction Decomposition 📦 | 14 | P1 | Pending |
| 35 | Entity Onboarding API 🚀 | 14 | P1 | Pending |
| **TOTAL** | | **168** | | **3/8 Complete** |

### Agent Contracting Governance

> **Design Philosophy:** Sly governs agent contracts — we don't become a marketplace, reputation provider, or escrow protocol. We wrap existing infrastructure with enterprise-grade governance, audit trails, and last-mile settlement.

#### Why Agent Contracting Matters

The OpenClaw/Moltbook ecosystem (140K+ GitHub stars, 1.5M+ agents) enables autonomous agent-to-agent contracting on platforms like m/hire and ClaWork. These agents negotiate, sign contracts, lock escrow, and settle payment — all autonomously. But enterprises deploying agents on Moltbook have no governance:

- No spending limits per counterparty
- No approval workflows for large contracts
- No reputation verification before committing funds
- No kill switch when things go wrong
- No settlement to local banking rails after escrow release

Sly fills this gap as the **governed settlement layer** that enterprises install between their agents and the contracting ecosystem.

#### Agent Contracting Epics Summary

| Epic | Name | Points | Priority | Status |
|------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 18 | Agent Wallets & Contract Policies 🤖 | 35 | P0 | Pending |
| 29 | Workflow Engine ⚙️ | 52 | P0/P1 | Pending |
| 62 | Escrow Orchestration 🔐 | 38 | P0 | Planned |
| 63 | External Reputation Bridge 🛡️ | 25 | P0 | Planned |
| 64 | OpenClaw Governance Skill 🧩 | 10 | P1 | Planned |
| **TOTAL** | | **160** | | **0/5 Complete** |
