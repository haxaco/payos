### One Integration. Every AI Shopper.

## The Problem

Your customers are already shopping through AI.

ChatGPT has 800M weekly users. Gemini is growing fast. Copilot just launched checkout. Each uses different protocols.

To reach them all, you'd need to integrate:
- ACP for ChatGPT and Copilot
- UCP for Gemini and Google AI Mode
- MCP for Claude-powered tools
- And whatever comes next

That's 4+ integrations today. More tomorrow. Your engineering team has better things to do.

---

## The Solution

PayOS accepts purchases from ANY AI surface through a single SDK.

One integration. Automatic protocol detection. Unified webhooks. When new protocols emerge, we add them. You don't rebuild.
