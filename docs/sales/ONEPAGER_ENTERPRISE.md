### Governance for AI Agents That Spend

---

## The Problem

Your AI agents can make purchases. But can you control them?

- What's the spending limit per agent?
- Who approves orders above threshold?
- Which vendors and categories are allowed?
- What happens when an agent makes a mistake?
- Where's the audit trail for compliance?

Protocols like AP2 prove authorization happened. They don't enforce YOUR business rules.

---

## The Solution

PayOS adds the governance layer that protocols lack.

Define policies. Set limits. Route approvals. Audit everything. Your agents move fast. You stay in control.

---

## Bidirectional by Design

Also sell to consumers via AI surfaces? Same platform, same integration. Governance works in both directions.

## What Becomes Possible

- Deploy procurement agents without losing financial control
