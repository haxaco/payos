## What is this?

We're building the orchestration layer for the autonomous economy—governance and trust infrastructure for AI agents participating in financial operations.

## What problem are you solving?

AI agents are starting to buy, sell, and move money. But:

- **Multiple protocols are emerging** (ACP, UCP, MCP, x402)—each backed by different tech giants, no clear winner
- **No standard exists** for enterprise agents to trigger traditional business operations with proper controls
- **Trust and compliance** for agent transactions is unsolved—who is this agent? What can it do? Who's responsible?

We're building the layer that handles protocol orchestration, governance, and agent trust (KYA—Know Your Agent) so businesses can participate in AI commerce safely.

## Who is this for?

- **Merchants** who want to accept transactions from AI-powered customers
- **Enterprises** deploying AI agents for financial operations
- **Fintechs** building AI-native products

## Why does this matter now?

ChatGPT has 800M weekly users. Google just launched Universal Commerce Protocol with Walmart and Shopify. Microsoft launched Copilot Checkout. Adobe reported 693% growth in AI-driven e-commerce traffic.

The infrastructure is being built right now. The standards are being set right now.

## Why do merchants need this?

Your customers are already shopping through AI. ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude—each uses different protocols. To reach them all, you'd need to integrate each one separately and keep up as they evolve.

We give you one integration to accept transactions from any AI surface, with visibility into what's working and controls over how you participate.

## Why do enterprises need this?

Your AI agents are ready to handle procurement, accounts payable, vendor payments. But today's agentic protocols weren't designed for enterprise operations—they don't include organizational policies, approval workflows, or audit trails.

We provide the governance layer that lets finance teams trust agents with real money: spending limits, approvals, compliance, and a complete audit trail.

## What do you actually provide?

**Protocol Orchestration** — One integration for all agentic commerce protocols.

**Governance** — Policies, approvals, and audit trails for agent transactions.

**Trust Layer** — KYA (Know Your Agent), compliance, and verification for agentic transactions.

**Settlement** — Bridge between stablecoin-native protocols and traditional rails.

## Where are you in development?

We're in private beta, working with design partners to validate the platform. We're looking for merchants and enterprises who want to shape how AI commerce infrastructure gets built.
