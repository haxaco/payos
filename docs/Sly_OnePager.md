# Sly One-Pager

**Sly — The Agentic Settlement Layer**

---

## The Problem

AI agents are here. Soon they'll pay and get paid: by customers, by other agents, by everyone. You want to move fast, but the landscape is a minefield. Multiple protocols. No clear winner. Building internally means expensive expertise and betting on technology that could be obsolete in months.

Wait too long, you fall behind. Bet wrong, you start over.

---

## The Opportunity

Move now without the risk. One integration gives you access to every major protocol (e.g., x402, AP2, ACP, UCP, MCP). Pick what fits your business and your customers. Add new ones as they emerge. Drop what doesn't work. No rebuild required.

Get to market faster. Reach more customers. At a fraction of the cost.
