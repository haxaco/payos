# Story 36.15: Deprecate Old SDKs - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Points**: 2  
**Completed**: January 3, 2026

## Summary

Successfully deprecated old SDK packages (`@sly/x402-client-sdk`, `@sly/x402-provider-sdk`, `@sly/api-client`) in favor of the new unified `@sly/sdk`, with comprehensive migration guide and deprecation notices.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Identified Old Packages

Found 3 packages to deprecate:
- ❌ `@sly/x402-client-sdk` - Old x402 client SDK
- ❌ `@sly/x402-provider-sdk` - Old x402 provider SDK  
- ❌ `@sly/api-client` - Old direct API client

### 2. Created Comprehensive Migration Guide

**File**: `/docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (650+ lines)

**Sections**:
1. **Deprecation Notice** - Clear warning and timeline
2. **Migration Timeline** - Key dates for action
3. **Quick Migration** - Install/import changes
4. **Migration by Package** - Detailed before/after for each SDK
5. **New Features Available** - What you get by migrating
6. **Breaking Changes** - What changed and why
7. **Step-by-Step Migration** - 7-step process
8. **Common Migration Issues** - Troubleshooting guide
9. **Testing Your Migration** - Validation steps
10. **Need Help?** - Support resources
11. **Checklist** - 13-point migration checklist

### 3. Updated Package Manifests

Added deprecation notices to `package.json`:

#### x402-client-sdk
```json
{
  "deprecated": "This package is deprecated. Please use @sly/sdk instead. See https://docs.payos.ai/migration for migration guide.",
  "description": "[DEPRECATED] Client SDK for consuming x402-enabled APIs with automatic payment handling. Use @sly/sdk instead."
}
```

#### x402-provider-sdk
```json
{
  "deprecated": "This package is deprecated. Please use @sly/sdk instead. See https://docs.payos.ai/migration for migration guide.",
  "description": "[DEPRECATED] Provider SDK for monetizing APIs with x402 - HTTP 402 Payment Required middleware. Use @sly/sdk instead."
}
```

#### api-client
*(Private package - no npm deprecation needed, but DEPRECATED.md created)*

### 4. Created Deprecation Notices

Created `DEPRECATED.md` files in each old package:
- `/packages/x402-client-sdk/DEPRECATED.md`
- `/packages/x402-provider-sdk/DEPRECATED.md`
- `/packages/api-client/DEPRECATED.md`

Each includes:
- ⚠️ Clear deprecation warning
- 📅 Timeline with key dates
- 🔄 Before/After code examples
- ✅ Benefits of migrating
- 📖 Links to migration guide
- 💬 Support resources

## Migration Guide Highlights

### Timeline Established

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Jan 3, 2026** | Old SDKs officially deprecated |
| **Feb 1, 2026** | Security updates only for old SDKs |
| **Apr 1, 2026** | Old SDKs become unmaintained |
| **Jul 1, 2026** | Old SDK packages removed from npm |

**Gives developers 3 months to migrate** (reasonable timeline)

### Before/After Examples

#### x402 Client Migration
```typescript
// ❌ Before (Old)
import { X402Client } from '@sly/x402-client-sdk';
const client = new X402Client({ apiKey, evmPrivateKey });
await client.fetch('https://api.example.com/protected');

// ✅ After (New)
import { PayOS } from '@sly/sdk';
const payos = new PayOS({ apiKey, environment: 'production', evmPrivateKey });
const x402Client = payos.x402.createClient();
await x402Client.fetch('https://api.example.com/protected');
```

#### x402 Provider Migration
```typescript
// ❌ Before (Old)
import { X402Provider } from '@sly/x402-provider-sdk';
const provider = new X402Provider({
  routes: { '/api/protected': { price: '0.01' } }
});
app.use('/api', provider.middleware());

// ✅ After (New)
import { PayOS } from '@sly/sdk';
const payos = new PayOS({ apiKey, environment: 'production' });
const provider = payos.x402.createProvider({
  'GET /api/protected': { price: '0.01', description: 'Protected resource' }
});
app.use('/api', provider.middleware());
```

#### API Client Migration
```typescript
// ❌ Before (Old)
import { PayOSApiClient } from '@sly/api-client';
const client = new PayOSApiClient({ apiKey });
await client.post('/settlements/quote', { amount: 100 });

// ✅ After (New)
import { PayOS } from '@sly/sdk';
const payos = new PayOS({ apiKey, environment: 'production' });
await payos.getSettlementQuote({ amount: '100', fromCurrency: 'USD', toCurrency: 'BRL' });
```

### Benefits Highlighted

✅ **Unified API** - One SDK for all protocols  
✅ **Better TypeScript** - Full type safety and IntelliSense  
✅ **Sandbox Mode** - Test without EVM keys or real transactions  
✅ **AI Integrations** - OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, Vercel  
✅ **Multi-Protocol** - x402, AP2, ACP  
✅ **Active Development** - Regular updates  
✅ **Better Docs** - Comprehensive guides  

### Breaking Changes Documented

1. **Configuration Structure** - Now requires `environment` parameter
2. **Error Format** - Structured errors with codes and suggested actions
3. **Response Format** - Consistent `{ data, success, timestamp }` structure

### Common Issues & Solutions

Documented 4 common migration issues:
1. "evmPrivateKey is required" → Use sandbox mode
2. "Module not found" → Update imports
3. "client.fetch is not a function" → Create x402 client first
4. Response structure changed → Update response handling

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Users don't see deprecation notice**
   - Mitigation: Multi-channel communication (email, Discord, docs)

2. **Migration takes longer than expected**
   - Mitigation: Extended timeline, dedicated support

3. **Breaking changes cause issues**
   - Mitigation: Detailed migration guide, before/after examples

4. **Users can't find migration help**
   - Mitigation: Prominent links in all deprecation notices

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues arise:
1. Extend deprecation timeline
2. Provide hotfixes for old SDKs (security only)
3. Create automated migration tool
4. Offer professional services for complex migrations
